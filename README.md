# skns
test solution

this solution uses 3 methods
1. PERL
2. Python
3. Go

p.s.
I wanted to make 3 variants of the solution, but with the workload I completely lost my free time, so I quickly put together a solution in Python.
since the server wss://test-ws.skns.dev/raw-messages did not send messages, I made it according to my feelings
